**The Minimum Wage and Inequality Between Groups**
with Francine Blau, [Matthew Comey](https://www.matthewcomey.com/), Lawrence Kahn, and [Nikolai Boboshko](https://nboboshko.github.io/)

*Conditionally accepted at ILR Review*

[NBER Working Paper (Sept. 2023)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31725)

We use 1979-2019 data from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS MORG) to study the effect of state and federal minimum wage policies on gender, race, and ethnic inequality, focusing on lower-tail inequality between men and women, Blacks and Whites, and Hispanics and Whites. First, we directly estimate the relationship between minimum wages and inequality using two reduced-form empirical strategies. We find that minimum wages substantially reduce gender, race, and ethnic wage inequality at least up to the 20th wage percentile, with no evidence of adverse employment effects. Then, we use these estimates to conduct counterfactual simulations of between-group inequality over four key epochs of minimum wage policy changes since 1979. Declines in the real minimum wage in the 1980s slowed progress in narrowing between-group inequality during that decade. Fairly muted shifts in national and state policies from 1989 to 1998 and 1998 to 2007 meant that the minimum wage was less important over those time spans, although there were some effects on race and ethnic wage inequality. Since 2007, several states have opted for steep minimum wage hikes, which we find have especially improved Hispanics’ relative wages, both because they continue to earn low wages and because they reside disproportionately in those states.  Finally, we make predictions about the effect of raising the federal minimum wage to $12. We find that a change of this magnitude would reduce existing between-group wage gaps below the 15th percentile by 25-50% and would therefore have an economically important impact.

**Demand for Social Security: Evidence from Patchwork Coverage**
with [Andrew Johnston](https://sites.google.com/site/andrewjohnstoneconomics/)

*Paper coming soon!*

By historical quirk, public schools in Georgia have a patchwork of Social Security coverage, which we use to measure worker demand for the program. When transferring schools, teachers exchange Social Security coverage for about 1.8 percent of salary per year on average, implying the marginal transferring worker values coverage at about a third of the employer cost and a fraction of the full social cost. Evidence from teacher flows between districts also suggests a low valuation of coverage. Our setting provides the first empirical estimates to quantify Hicksian transfers for Social Security reform.
